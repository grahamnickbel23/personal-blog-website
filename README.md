# My Personal Blog Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog website.

I built this project to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. It's a full-stack application designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to manage.

## Tech Stack

I used the **MERN Stack** to build this application, splitting it into a clear frontend and backend structure:

*   **Frontend (Client):** Built with **React** and **Vite** for a blazing fast development experience. I used **Tailwind CSS** for styling to keep things clean and modern, and **Framer Motion** for those smooth animations you see throughout the site.
*   **Backend (Server):** Powered by **Node.js** and **Express**. It handles things like my blog posts, contact form submissions, and other dynamic data.
*   **Database:** I'm using **MongoDB** to store my data.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Project Showcase:** I can easily add and update my projects.
*   **Blog Section:** A space for me to share my thoughts and technical articles.
*   **Contact Form:** A direct way for visitors to get in touch with me.
*   **Responsive Design:** Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Frontend .env has pushed to git as it contain api-key

Thanks for checking out my work!
